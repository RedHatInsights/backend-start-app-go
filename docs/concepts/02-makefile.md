## Makefile

Golan has a tooling around many commands.
We believe it is helpful to customize these commands for actual project needs.

We help document all the current targets by providing the `make help` we encourage you to continue this effort.
It makes it very easy for new developers to see what common actions are needed for working on the project.

We drafted the Makefile targets split under `mk` directory,
so it's easier to keep targets grouped by their purpose.
