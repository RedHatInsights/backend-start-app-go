## Documentation for your project

This is a bit meta you say, sure it is! :)

We believe starting with documentation is important, so you don't need to catch up later.

### Architecture

Start with simple architecture of your project.

You've sure brainstormed it before starting, just put in the `docs` folder what you have!
Diagrams can be plain `png`s of course, but if you want to start with something better, do it with PlantUML.
It helps you keep it up to date, because you keep the source code of the diagram with the code.

### Architecture Decision Records

These Markdown documents are meant to document major decisions you've taken during your project development.
Changing decisions is easy with a follow-up ADR, but you get an awesome benefit of the track record for the decisions.
That's very helpful for every new developer, like you after few months working on something else ;)
